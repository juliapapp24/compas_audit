This project was an assignment in Cornell's INFO 4390: Designing Fair Algorithms that I completed. This assignment was derives in part, with thanks and permission, from an assignment in Stanford's CS182: Ethics, Public Policy, and Technological Change. The project is based on the journalistic organization ProPublica's analysis of a criminal risk prediction algorithm which we discussed in the algorithmic fairness lecture. Here, I will be assessing how a classifier designed to predict recidivism -- that is, whether someone will commit a crime in the future -- performs in terms of algorithmic fairness metrics.
